# ðŸŒ² LLM-Forest

This repository contains the implementation of [**LLM-Forest**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21520), our ACL 2025 Findings paper.  
LLM-Forest is a **task-agnostic framework** that ensembles the outputs of multiple large language models (LLMs) based on diverse prompt generations, inspired by the idea of random forests.  

---

## General Framework

LLM-Forest constructs diverse prompts for a given task (e.g., Question Answering, Text Generation, Classification), obtains multiple outputs from LLMs, and aggregates them through self-evaluated confidence-weighted voting.

## LLM-Forest for Data Imputation

We instantiate LLM-Forest for **tabular data imputation**, where the goal is to fill in missing values in health datasets.  
The process includes graph construction, prompt generation, LLM-based imputation, and ensemble aggregation to yield an **imputed table** for downstream tasks (e.g., classification).

## Reproducing the Results

There are **no strict environment requirements** for this project and it can run under most standard Python setups.  
You can simply install the minimal dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To reproduce the results in our paper, here is an example for Diabetes dataset with GPT-4:

```bash
python main.py \
  --data_path ./data/diabetes_train4.csv \
  --dataset diabetes \
  --model_name gpt \
  --num_round 3 \
  --group_size 2 \
  --num_neighbors 5
```
